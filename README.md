Hello!

This repository contains 5 projects that we worked on for our Software Methodology class where learned and applied foundational skills needed for Software Engineering. The projects are:

    Project 1: A console-based interactive user interface that manages a student roster for a university, written in Java
    Project 2: An extension of Project 1, adding additional functionalities for processing the tuitions of students in the roster
    Project 3: A GUI created with JavaFX that revamps the user interface from Project 2
    Project 4: A GUI for a Cafe that allows users to take, place, and cancel orders using JavaFX
    Project 5: A Java Android app that extends the functionality of Project 4 and enhances it as a mobile app
